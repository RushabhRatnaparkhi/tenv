# Bash Completion Implementation for tenv

## Summary

Successfully implemented bash completion for installed tool versions in the tenv project. The feature addresses the user's request to get completion suggestions for locally installed versions when using `tenv <tool> use` commands.

## Changes Made

### Modified `cmd/tenv/subcmd.go`

Added `ValidArgsFunction` to three key commands:

1. **`use` command**: 
   - Completes with locally installed versions using `versionManager.LocalSet()`
   - Includes common version strategies: `latest`, `latest-stable`, `latest-pre`, `latest-allowed`, `min-required`

2. **`install` command**:
   - Completes with version strategies first (most commonly used)
   - Falls back to locally installed versions as examples
   - Optimized for performance (no slow remote API calls during completion)

3. **`uninstall` command**:
   - Completes with locally installed versions
   - Includes special uninstall options: `all`, `but-last`

## Key Features

- ✅ **Fast completion**: Uses `LocalSet()` method which just reads directory names
- ✅ **Error handling**: Gracefully handles cases where no versions are installed
- ✅ **Quiet mode**: Initializes displayer in quiet mode during completion to avoid output noise
- ✅ **Cross-tool support**: Works for all tools (tofu, terraform, terragrunt, terramate, atmos)
- ✅ **Strategy completion**: Provides common version resolution strategies
- ✅ **Context-aware**: Different completions for different commands

## Usage

Users can enable completion by:

```bash
# Generate completion script
tenv completion bash > ~/.tenv_completion.bash

# Add to bashrc
echo 'source ~/.tenv_completion.bash' >> ~/.bashrc

# Or source directly
source ~/.tenv_completion.bash
```

## Testing

The implementation has been tested with:
- Multiple installed versions
- Empty installation directories  
- All supported tools (tofu, terraform, etc.)
- Real bash completion scenarios

Example completion output for `tenv tofu use <TAB>`:
```
1.10.5  1.10.6  latest  latest-stable  latest-pre  latest-allowed  min-required
```

## Impact

This enhancement significantly improves the user experience by:
- Reducing typing and potential errors
- Providing discovery of available versions
- Maintaining consistency with other CLI tools that support completion
- Working seamlessly with existing bash completion infrastructure
